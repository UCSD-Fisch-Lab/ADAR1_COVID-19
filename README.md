Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by ADAR1 has been implicated in maintaining self-tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, and antiviral immunity. Foreign viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers rapid interferon response and activates ADAR1 in the host immune system.  Emerging data points to a role of ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing in the inflammatory response associated with severe COVID-19 disease. We identify A-to-I editing events within human whole transcriptome data from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, non-infected individuals, and individuals with other viral illnesses from nasopharyngeal swabs. High levels of RNA editing in host cells is associated with low SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p  = 9.3 E-06), suggesting an inhibitory effect of ADAR1 on viral infection. Additionally, we find differentially expressed genes associated with RNA-modifications and interferon response. Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected nasopharyngeal swabs reveals that cytotoxic CD8 T cells upregulate ADAR1 in COVID-19 positive samples (p = 0.03). We further revealed increased ADAR1 expression with CD4 and CD8 T cell activation, and knockdown of ADAR1 leads to apoptosis and aberrant IL-2 secretion. Together, our data suggest A-to-I RNA editing is required to maintain healthy homeostasis of activated T-cells to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
